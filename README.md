We were ranked in the 8-12th bracket in the [International Qualifying Tournament](https://www.battlecode.org/#/tournaments/results?id=3).

Rather than trying to implement the much vaunted flying mage strategy, we focused towards the knight rush meta.

### What is BattleCode?

Battlecode is a real-time strategy game, for which you will write an AI player. In Battlecode, two teams of virtual robots roam the screen managing resources and executing different offensive strategies against each other. Your AI player will need to strategically manage your robot army and control how your robots work together to defeat the enemy team. As a contestants, you will learn to use artificial intelligence, pathfinding, distributed algorithms, and network communications to make your player as competitive as possible.

TODO - Add a strategy report.
