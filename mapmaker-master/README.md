Battlecode 2018 Unofficial Mapmaking Tool

Dependencies:
* Python 3.5
* pygame (pip3 install pygame)

To run:
`python3 main.py`

Other than that, the tool is fairly self-explanatory.
If you notice a bug, feel free to open a pull request!
Have fun!

Disclaimer: I haven't extensively tested the tool against the game. This may cause the Docker engine to crash.
I'm not liable for any wasted disk space as a result of restarting the Docker container.
Use at your own risk, however minimal it may be.
